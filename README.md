# About
Welcome to Sun Voyage! Visit planets and dwarf planets in the Solar System to learn more about each, and to see what your age and weight would be in a different world. Interact with other galactic travelers by sharing your experiences and sight-seeing recommendations in the comments of each planet!

And click [here](https://github.com/patricia-pan/sun-voyage-client) to view the client github repo.

You don't need an account to view planets and others' comments, but you will need one to add your own and to update your profile.
